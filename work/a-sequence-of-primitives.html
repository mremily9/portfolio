        <h1>Assignment 1: A sequence of primitives</h1>
        <h2>Design 240</h2>
        <h2>Research</h2>

        <p>
            Starting with this assignment was looking into what sdgs I wanted to go into when looking for a statstic to work on. I found to be drawn to goal 12 - Responsible consumption and production. 
            As I wanted to look specifically into fashion/textile waste that is done due to the lack of responsible consumption and production that can be seen within fast fashion and retail. 
            As someone working in retail - I see how much waste is done to put stock onto the shelves.  
        </p>
        <img src="https://sdgs.un.org/sites/default/files/2023-08/SDG_report_2023_infographics_Goal%2012.jpg">
        <br>

        <p>
            I had then looked into different statstics I could look into and found 3 main statstics I liked. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>
            New Zealand sends about 100,000 tonnes of clothing to landfill each year â€“ about 44kg per person.
        </h2>
        <p>
            I had found this statstic to be interesting, however there wasnt any lnk to where the data was found, only tracing back to a nzherald article. There isnt any signs of where the numbers come from and so I didn't go ahead with this statstic. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>
            Auckland Council estimates that textiles are currently 9% of their landfills, and that at current growth rates this would rise to 14% by 2040
        </h2>
            <p>
                This statstic was interesting and heavily links to New Zealand and specifically Auckland. It showcases the increase growing in terms of how bad throwing away textiles are. 
            </p>
            <br>
        <h2>
            3,106 tonnes of clothing are wasted before being sold or worn.
        </h2>
        <p>
            Both the of the last two statistics are more reliable, as they link back to where the data is found. 
            However, I went with the last statstic as I felt it represented the ideas of responsible consumption better rather than just the general idea of waste and its link with textiles. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <img src="../imgs/workImg/240/stats.png" style="width:100%;">

        <br><br>
        
        <h2>
            Process
        </h2>
        <p>
            I had then started on creating a GIF to then represent the idea of this statstic. I had documented this process within miro which can be looked at below. 
        </p>
        <iframe width="768" height="432" src="https://miro.com/app/live-embed/uXjVNmcjx3A=/?moveToViewport=-5319,-3485,10601,6684&embedId=647529040008" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allow="fullscreen; clipboard-read; clipboard-write" allowfullscreen></iframe>

        <h2>
            Final Output
        </h2>
        <img src="../imgs/workImg/240/a1_copy.gif">

        <h2>Artist intent</h2>
        <p>
            I've been interested and drawn to the sdg goal 12 of responsible consumption and production as It felt like a goal that links with the people, with the consumers. As such I wanted to look into fast fashion and retail, how consumers buy and their choices.
            <br>
            <br>
            I had chosen the statistic of "3,106 tonnes of clothing are wasted before being sold or worn.", as I had felt this showcased the irresponsible production and consumption of clothing within Auckland.
            <br>
            <br>
            To showcase this, I had wanted to deliver a visual narrative of this process, showing a new piece of clothing getting thrown within a pile of landfill, thus being wasted before being sold or worn. To help show how new this piece of T-Shirt is, I had added in a price tag and shining diamond shapes to show how brand new it is. Which get smaller overtime as the T-Shirt falls and the price tag falls off the T-Shirt itself.
            <br>
            <br>
            I had used colours to help further show the difference between the "new" and the "wasted". With the new clothing being in white, a pure and bright colour, vs the black landfill of darkness and waste.
            <br>
            <br>
            The ending frame shows the statistic as a text to help further allow people to understand the statistic. It also shows the price tag now a part of the pile, the new clothing being thrown away in the landfill.

        <!-- <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <p>I had found the physical paper folding process very fun, as I liked making and putting things together physically. I had also found the concept making portion interesting, as it had really made me think about how an unusually shaped object could be made into many practical and useful objects. 
            I had often thought of smaller objects for my concepts, because of this I feel like I could potentially look at larger scaled objects for the concepts as well to improve this area. 
            
            In terms of finding my craft, within this project as I liked the physical hands-on making of the model I would say the folding and putting together of the net is my craft. To improve this, I would continue to make more 3D models, with higher difficulty in terms of how complex the folding is. 
        </p> -->
        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <p>
            Within this whole asisgnment I had learnt more about coding and how to create visualizations within code and in processing. I go tto explore Java and coding aspects such as learning about arrays, conditionals and using random functions. 
            I felt the limitation within this assignment allowed for us to get used to coding with the shapes itself and to not lean towards using images and illustrations - skills which us designers have - to help aid within our design. It was a great base for this course as a first assignment and I cant wait to learn and explore more - espically on the interaction side of things. 
        </p>
