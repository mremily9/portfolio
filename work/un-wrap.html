        <h1>Unwrap</h1>
        <h2>Design 100</h2>
        <h2>Process</h2>
        <p>I had first started out making the composite 3D shape by combining the three 3D geometric primitives. I had done this within Blender, as I knew that there was an add-on that allows for the 3D model made to a folded paper model net.</p>

        <p>I had made a few different models by combining some of the 3D geometric primitives and had come to like the hexagon on top of the flattened cube, as it was a simple shape that didn't feel overly complicated and somewhat messy. 

            Small iterations I add done to this chosen 3D model were to make sure the objects lined up together with each other well so that the paper net could be made straightforwardly.
            </p>
        <img src="unwrap/process2.png">
        <p>I had then started making the physical model. I printed out and cut out the net. </p>

        <p>I then scored each of the folded lines (dotted lines on the net) by using a ruler and a sharp edge (in this case I used a blade from a pair of scissors). 
            After scoring I had glued all the tabs together by using a q-tip to spread the liquid glue onto the tabs. I had also used tape to help hold down some of the folds, on the inside, as the glue dried.

        <h2>Final model</h2>
        <img src="unwrap/final.png">
        <p>Here are the pictures of the final physical paper model. </p>
        <br>
        <h2>concepts</h2>
        <img src="unwrap/10concept.png">
        <p>Above are the concept ideas I had created for the model. I had sketched and annotated the concept ideas.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <p>I had found the physical paper folding process very fun, as I liked making and putting things together physically. I had also found the concept making portion interesting, as it had really made me think about how an unusually shaped object could be made into many practical and useful objects. 
            I had often thought of smaller objects for my concepts, because of this I feel like I could potentially look at larger scaled objects for the concepts as well to improve this area. 
            
            In terms of finding my craft, within this project as I liked the physical hands-on making of the model I would say the folding and putting together of the net is my craft. To improve this, I would continue to make more 3D models, with higher difficulty in terms of how complex the folding is.
