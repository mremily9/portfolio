        <h1>CCC</h1>
        <h2>Design 100</h2>
        <p>I had started by looking up images of existing laser cut keychains with a logo on them specifically.</p>

        <h2>Ideation</h2>
        <img src="CCC/ideas.png">
        <p>I had created many sketches on ideas of what type of logo I could do, as well as the shapes of keychains and how they could be incorporated. 
            I wasn't entirely sure what I could do in terms of a logo, so I had explored with both general shapes and recognisable shapes/forms. 
            I had ended up choosing the frog logo idea, as I felt it was better to have a more recognisable form than a more abstract form. 
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <h2>Iteration</h2>
        <img src="CCC/iteration.png">
        <p>For the iteration, I had brought some of the ideas I had explored within the ideation, such as the round cut out shapes around the shape. 
            I had explored these in groups, such as cutouts, basic shapes and the laser cutting of the logo itself. 
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <h2>Progress</h2>
        <img src="CCC/rihno.png">
        <p>I had created the vector file for the laser cutting within the program Rihno7. This was my first time working with this program, so I learned while making it. It was also the first time I had created a vector file for laser cutting, so I had to learn the sizes and colour set up for it, such as red vector lines indicating it to be a cut line. 
            I had exported then exported the vector for the keychain in .svg to allow for it to be laser cut. 
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <img src="CCC/final.png">
        <p>Thoughts on your final design, and what might you do to improve it further?
            <br>Overall, I went with a more simple and basic design, as I thought it would be better to keep it simple rather than adding too much detail that could overwhelm the keychain. 
            I feel like I could've changed it to a more exciting shape or added some of the cutting out detail to make it more visually interesting. 
            <br><br>
            What is the most significant lesson I've learnt through this project?
            <br>One of the most impactful things I learned from this project is learning a new program, Rihno7. At first, I was somewhat frustrated with the user interface of the program and felt it was hard to learn by playing around. However, after finding out resources, I had gotten the hang of it and learnt to use tools such as trim, hatch and fillet. 
            <br><br>
            How will this lesson influence my life tomorrow?
            <br>This lesson will influence me tomorrow by being more patient on what I don't fully understand.
